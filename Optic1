Problem 1: Analyze apparent depth and velocity in a spherical liquid container

There is a transparent, thin-walled, spherical container of radius R, filled with a transparent liquid of refractive index n. A ball is dropped from the top of the container at a constant velocity v relative to the container. Due to light refraction, the apparent depth h (which is also the position of the image of the ball) differs from its actual depth H (Figure 3). The motion of the ball is observed from a large distance relative to the container.

1. At what position of the sphere will its apparent depth h coincide with its true depth H, regardless of the refractive index of the liquid and the viewing angle? Explain.

2. Find the dependence of h on H when H < R and when H ≥ R. Comment on the results obtained.

3. Let u be the velocity of the image of the ball. Find u in terms of H, R, v, and n.


Solution:
**1. Position with h = H (independent of n and viewing direction)**

When the ball is at the center of the spherical surface’s curvature, all rays from the ball strike the inner surface perpendicularly, so there is no refraction anywhere on the surface. The center of curvature of the top cap is the sphere’s center, at depth $R$ below the top point.

$$\boxed{H = R \ \Rightarrow\ h = H\ \text{for any}\ n\ \text{and any viewing direction}}.$$

Explanation: for $H=R$, every radius is a surface normal; incidence angle $=0$; hence no angular or positional shift.

**2. Apparent depth h as a function of H**

Model the top interface as a single <keyword>spherical refracting surface</keyword> (paraxial). Using the standard paraxial refraction formula for a spherical surface,
$$
\frac{n_1}{s}+\frac{n_2}{s'}=\frac{n_2-n_1}{R_s},
$$
with $n_1=n$ (inside), $n_2=1$ (air), object distance $s=H$ measured from the surface into the liquid, image distance $s'$ measured into air, and radius $R_s=-R$ (center on the incident side). The image seen from air is virtual and lies back inside the liquid, so $s'=-h$. Then
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{n}{H}+\frac{1}{-h}&=\frac{1-n}{-R} \\[4pt]
\frac{n}{H}-\frac{1}{h}&=\frac{n-1}{R} \\[4pt]
\frac{1}{h}&=\frac{n}{H}-\frac{n-1}{R}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Hence
$$
\boxed{h(H)=\frac{H R}{\,n R-(n-1)H\,}}.
$$

- Limiting check ($R\to\infty$): $h\to H/n$ (plane interface).
- Compare with $H$:
$$
h-H=\frac{(n-1)H(H-R)}{\,nR-(n-1)H\,}.
$$
Therefore:
- If $H<R$ (above the center): $h<H$ — the ball appears shallower than it is.
- If $H=R$: $h=H$ — exact coincidence.
- If $H\ge R$ (at or below the center): $h>H$ — the ball appears deeper than it is.

**3. Velocity u of the image**

Let the ball descend with constant speed $v$, so $H$ increases at rate $dH/dt=v$. From $h(H)$,
$$
\frac{dh}{dH}
=\frac{d}{dH}\left(\frac{H R}{n R-(n-1)H}\right)
=\frac{n R^{2}}{\big(n R-(n-1)H\big)^{2}}.
$$
Thus the image speed relative to the container is
$$
\boxed{u(H)=\frac{n R^{2}}{\big(n R-(n-1)H\big)^{2}}\;v}.
$$
In particular, at $H=R$ one has $u=n v$.
